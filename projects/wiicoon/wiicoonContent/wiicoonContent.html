        <h1>WIICOON PROJECT</h1>
        <p>
            Wiicoon was a project completely made by Luis Fernando Perez Salcedo and me (Ricardo Coronado Galindo),
             at that time we were just engineering graduates so we started a project/company and learned a lot of 
             things in the middle of the way.

            The objective was to make an electronic device that allows control of home lights with smartphones sounds 
            very simple at the beginning, but was a long trip, sometimes funny, sometimes not so much.
             <br><br>
             Hardware design was my responsibility, we wanted to make a very small device because the idea was to put it into 
             the electrical socket and reconnect there the electrical wires. you can see some of the original drawings <a href="https:\\youtube.com">here.</a>
             <br> <br>
             The Microcontroller program was made by Luis Fernando, who started to know better the esp8266 microcontroller than his family. 
             (joke) note: we never used git tools in the whole project so versions, and controls were a headache and probably we lost some 
             interesting versions and updates. Anyway, here you can find one of the ultimate versions of the<a href="https://github.com/sonricardo/wiicoonHardware">ESP8266 code.</a>

             Apps were under my charge oh yes, I learned since Zero, not only code apps but also the POO paradigm I remember was very exciting.
              It took 3 months, of course, and after 2 or 3 months to make the Android, app repository 
            <a href="https://github.com/sonricardo/wiicoonAppAndroid">here</a>.  after this, I made an iOS app, of course, cleaner than Android 
            and faster, maybe 1-month course and 2 months of coding. I remember that swift language, it's so much easier than Java for Android, and Kotlin was not Google-supported at that moment. Well then<a href="https://github.com/sonricardo/WiicoonIosApp">here </a> is the repository.
            <br><br>
           
            Luis Fernando coded a DB, in node JS. To be honest, I don't know anything about this, but worked we were controlling our device 
            remotely, that was one of the most exciting moments of the whole project.
            <br><br>
            right now I don't have code or any about our server with node JS anyway, I have thought to make it again with Google Firebase. 
            I miss how we are working and developing this project, some parts looked promising and just stopped of made. for example,
             we could update by remote internet not only both apps (android, iOS) but also the electronic device!!! It's fantastic. 
            <br><br>

            I love this project, and someday I will continue working just out of passion. here are some videos about how wiicoon works.
