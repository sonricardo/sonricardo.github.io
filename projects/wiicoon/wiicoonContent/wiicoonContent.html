        <h1>PRUEBAS .....</h1>
        <p>
            Wiicoon was a project completely made it by Luis Fernando Perez Salcedo and me, at that time we were just engineering graduates 
            so we started a project/company and learned a lot of things in the middle of the way.
            <br>
            The objective was made an electronic device which allows control home light with smartphones sounds very simple at the beginning,
            but was a long trip, sometimes funny, sometimes not so much.
             <br>
            Hardware design was my responsibility, we wanted to make a very small device because the idea was put it into the electrical socket
             and reconnect there the electrical wires. you can see some of the original drawings <a href="https:\\youtube.com">here.</a>
             <br> 
             The Microcontroller program was made by Luis Fernando, who started to know better the esp8266 microcontroller than his family. 
             (joke) note: we never use git tools in whole project so versions, controls were a headache and probably we lost some interesting
             version and updates. Anyway, here you can find one of the ultimates versions of the esp8266 code
            <br> 
            Apps was under my charge oh yes, I learned since Zero, not only code apps, but also POO paradigm I remember was very excited.
            I took 3 months, of course, and after 2 or 3 months to make the android app repository here [link]. after this I made ios app, 
            of course cleaner than android and  faster, maybe 1 month course and 2 months coding. I remember that swift language, its so much 
            easier than Java for android, and Kotlin it was not google supported
            at this moment. Well then here is a repository.
            <br>
            Luis Fernando coded a DB, in node JS. to be honest, I don't know nothing about this, but worked we are controlling our device
             remote, that was one of the excited moments of whole project
            <br>
            right now I don't have code or any about our server with node JS anyway, I have thought to make it again with google fire base.
            I miss how we are working and developing this project, some parts looked promising and just stoped of make.
            for example, we could update by remote internet not only both apps (android, iOS) but also the electronic device!!! It's fantastic. 
            <br>

            I really love this project, and someday I will continue working just for pasion.
            here some videos about how wiicoon works
